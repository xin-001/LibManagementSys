# LibManagementSys


The library system can have two systems. One is the system for the administrator to manage books. 
The administrator can 
(1) find a book, 
(2) add new books, 
(3) delete old books, 
(4) check which books are in the library,
(5) exit the management system.


The other is let students borrow books. When we go to the library, we can 
(1) find the situation of a book, 
(2) borrow a book, 
(3) return a book, 
(4) exit the management system.
