<p>
This library manager app supports two kinds of users. One is for the administrator to manage books. 
The administrator can <br/>
(1) find a book, <br/>
(2) add new books, <br/>
(3) delete old books, <br/>
(4) check which books are in the library,<br/>
(5) exit the management system.<br/>

The other is to let students borrow books. When we go to the library, we can <br/>
(1) find the status of a book,<br/> 
(2) borrow a book,<br/> 
(3) return a book,<br/> 
(4) exit the management system.<br/>
